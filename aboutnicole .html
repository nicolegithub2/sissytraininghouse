                                <p>I am a young dominatrix that seemed to be born dominant. I refused to be told how, what, and when to think about societies norms and values. I love to challenge what living in this world really is, and it does sadden me when I see people stuck and trapped in a life they are not happy living. I have many dreams and hopes in this world but my main one is to create my own little world where animals and humans are free to exist without fear or harm of abuse. This includes people that want to change their gender, transgender people, and kinky little sissies! <br>It is great being a Pro-Domme, it gives me the chance to meet so many people from alternative ways of thinking, kinks, and even worlds! It is a wonderful experience to encourage, watch, and demand a person's true self come out in front of you. Sometimes the person can only be themselves for those one or two hours they are with me... This sometimes bugs me, since I want to see and help the subs that come to see me to be brave, take a chance, and embrace their inner yearnings. <br>But I guess you are wondering why such an interest in sissies.... Well, ain't they beautiful human beings?... And gosh they sure can be kinky! My interest in sissies and my love for them started many years ago.&nbsp;.</p>

                            <div class="mbr-section-text">
                                <p>I met the most beautiful transgender woman when I was young. She lived in a penthouse, with a fancy car, clothes, and even young men surrounding her. She drew everyone's attention when she walked into the room. Everyone wanted to be around her and try to get a moment of her time. There was also this amazing aura and elegance to her. It was only later I got to find out she used to be miserable, had endless health problems, was stuck in a low paying job, and felt trapped in a man's body. However, she managed to change her circumstances and herself through part luck but mostly through hard work and doing an alternative job to what others do. A whole new world opened up to her once she took that step into her new lifestyle, and the world changed around her. This is not to say that it was all easy and she never faced difficulties. I later found out that she had a kind of guardian that helped and protected her while she transitioned into who she is now. She doesn't regret a thing and always smiles fondly about her guardian. I have had sessions with lots of subs that want to be full-time sissies, that go back to their vanilla life and then long to be that sissy again the next time we meet. It makes me think about how much their world and their life could change if they too had a guardian to help and support them into their transition... so I am going to be that guardian, protector, advisor, and trainer to any wannabe sissy or pre- transgender woman that is out there.&nbsp;</p>
